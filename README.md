- 👋 Hi, I’m @ralabarta

I am a developer passionate about what I do and who likes the challenge of working on innovative projects and being part of a creative and committed team. My main focus is on software development, although I also have
experience leading teams and as an architect. I like to stay up-to-date with emerging technologies and participate in FORUMS and discussions on those topics. I am an advocate of maintaining respect and professionalism in the work
environment. I consider myself a chess and literature enthusiast and a complete music lover. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading books, at the movies, or at the theater. I have 10 years of experience in designing and
implementing software solutions in different contexts and with high quality standards. I specialize in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, C ++, Ruby, Go, and Rust.
